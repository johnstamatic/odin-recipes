    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Chili Pepper Water</em></strong> is a local condiment that is made throughout the Hawaiian islands. The Hawaiian Chili is a varietal of the Thai bird chili and it grows year round in Hawaii. There are many versions of the recipes, but the base is Hawaiian chilies, sea salt, and water. You can add vinegar, garlic, and ginger to taste. Some recipes even include soy sauce and local juices.</p>
        <p>
            The longer it sits, the more potent and tasty it gets. If you don't have Hawaiian Chili Peppers in your area, you can substitute another type of hot pepper.
